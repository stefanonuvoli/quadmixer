ReAntTweakBar is a minimal wrapper for the AntTweakBar library that allows
"bars" to be saved and load from disk. Changing your existing app that users
AntTweakBar to use ReAntTweakBar is trivial.

This directory should contain:
  README
  example.cpp
  example  (option example binary)
  temp.rbr (optional example ReAntTweakBar output)

Many (but not all) variable types are supported. I'll try to keep track them
here:
  TW_TYPE_BOOLCPP
  TW_TYPE_QUAT4F
  TW_TYPE_COLOR4F
  TW_TYPE_COLOR3F
  TW_TYPE_DIR3F
  TW_TYPE_BOOL32
  TW_TYPE_INT32
  TW_TYPE_FLOAT
  TW_TYPE_DOUBLE
  and
  custom TwTypes made with TwDefineEnum

I'm working on adding the rest on an as-needed basis. Adding a new type only
requires changes in a few places...

Look in example.cpp for an example of how to compile with ReAntTweakBar and use
it.
