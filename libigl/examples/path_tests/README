file_exists, is_readable, is_writable, functions of the igl library


To Build:
  make

To Run:
  ./example [path_1] [path_2] ... [path_n]

Example Run #1:
  Issuing:
    touch not-writable
    touch not-readable
    chmod u-r not-readable 
    chmod u-w not-writable 
    ./example       / . .. example.cpp non-existant-file not-readable not-writable > output
    php example.php / . .. example.cpp non-existant-file not-readable not-writable > php-output
    diff php-output output
  should produce no differences
