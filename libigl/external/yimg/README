YImage:
    A simple pixel buffer class that can
        - save and load itself as a PNG (preserving alpha channel)
        - set color-plane layout (compile-time)
        - resize/flip/mirror/greyscale

showpng:
    An example GLUT application using YImage that takes a PNG file as
    argument and displays it over a horrible green background.
    If no argument given loads included "sakura.png" file.
    Clicking inside the window displays a menu of commands.
    Keys are:
        - f: flip()
        - m: mirror()
        - g: greyscale()
        - s: save( "output.png" ).
        - c: captures current window backbuffer into "screen-capture.png"
        - q: quit

transparent.html:
    A basic web page to test the transparency of a PNG named "output.png".
    Try with the "output.png" generated by pressing 's' in showpng.
